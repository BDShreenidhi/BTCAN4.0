i.	Initially the RFID reader is in idle state, waiting for a RFID card to be detected.
ii.	On reading the RFID card, we will get a UID which consists of 12 characters which is stored in a string using SPI protocol.
iii.	In which, we will receive the one data bit for 1 clock pulse.
iv.	Hence, we will receive 12 data bits at 12 clock pulses. 
v.	We will compare the received UID with the registered UID using an if-else statement.
vi.	If the received UID is matching with the registered UID then, it will print the UID and the employee details on the serial terminal.
vii.	Where the serial terminal is set at a baud rate of 9600bps.
viii.	If the UID is matching, then it will send a string which contains Employee name through Bluetooth using UART protocol.
ix.	Where, the transfer of data bits takes place at a speed of 9600bps. 
x.	We need to make sure that both the devices are set to the same baud rate since UART is an asynchronous protocol.
xi.	Initially, the UART bus is at 1, when the connection is established between the module and the smartphone the bus is set to 0.
xii.	This indicates that the data transmission is about to start.
xiii.	Whereas, the receiver buffer at the smartphone is initially 0.
xiv.	When the data is received in the reciever buffer bit by bit the flag becomes 1.
xv.	When the reciever flag is set to 1, the data should be read inorder to receive the next byte of data.
xvi.	The read character should be printed on the Serial Bluetooth terminal.
xvii.	On receiving the data, if the UID is matching, the employee details are displayed on the Serial Bluetooth terminal app.
xviii.	On receiving the data, if the UID is not matching, then “Access Denied” message is displayed on the Serial Bluetooth terminal app.
